core concepts

Register
- Greater focus on easy registration with Google. People don't want to remember passwords

welcome
- Welcome: create a relationship of trust with the user
- Presentation of some things that the user can do in Builderall: reinforces the idea that the user made the right choice when creating the account

Dashboard
- The idea is not to have many animations, an innovative design or something revolutionary. But keep everything organized and easy to access
- My apps: one-click access, easy search (no need to open accordions or visually search)
- Suggested projects: as well as today's start a project. Only more visible and in line with what was exposed in the welcome
- Learn builderall: trainings that are currently on the menu. Gives more visibility and strengthens customer learning
- Quick access to account data: plan, payment status, upgrade button, used storage space
- Quick access to links to Builderall support, knowledge base and social media
- Apps menu https://prnt.sc/swGjQp_OY9fU. It facilitates quick access to apps. It has the same idea as today's mega menu, only in the style already adopted by Google, Microsoft... The main problem with today's mega menu is that you have to visually search for the application (without a search box for example ) and takes up a lot of screen space

All
- Lottie animations (modern look)
- Gradient background colors (modern look)
- Minimalism (clean design and display only what is necessary)
- Inspirations: Google, Adobe, LottieFiles
